 * @brief Rate of change filter.
 * Calculate the change rate (ie: slope) between two points, if it is above a user given value, reject the point.
 *  - If one argument is provided, it is interpreted as the absolute value of the maximum permissible rate of change (per seconds). This means that
 *    every point where <em>|local_rate_of_change| \> argument</em> is rejected
 *  - If two arguments are provided, they are interpreted as the minimum and the maximum (respectively) permissible rate of change (per seconds). This means that
 *    every point where <em>local_rate_of_change \< argument1 AND local_rate_of_change \> argument2</em> is rejected
 *
 * @code
 * TA::filter1	= rate
 * TA::arg1	= -0.01 0.015
