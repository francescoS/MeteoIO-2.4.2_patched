 * @date   2011-11-11
 * @brief Filters out snow melting in an unheated rain gauge.
 * This filter can ONLY be applied to precipitation. Non-zero measurements are accepted only if they take place
 * when the relative humidity is greater than 0.5 and (TA-TSS) < 3, otherwise they get reset to 0.
 * It can take two optional arguments overwriting these thresholds. If none of these conditions could be tested
 * (for lack of data), then the precipitation is reset to nodata. On the contrary, if the "soft" option is given,
 * the lack of validation data keeps the precipitation as it is.
 *
 * @code
 * HNW::filter2	= unheated_raingauge
 * HNW::arg2	= soft 0.5 3.
