/**
 * @class  FilterMedianAvg
 * @ingroup processing
 * @author Thomas Egger
 * @date   2011-01-24
 * @brief Median average processing.
 * The median average filter returns the median value of all values within a user given time window. Remarks:
 * - nodata values are excluded from the median
 * - if there is an even number of window elements the arithmetic mean of the two central elements is used to calculate the median
 * - Two arguments expected (both have to be fullfilled for the filter to start operating):
 *   - minimal number of points in window
 *   - minimal time interval spanning the window (in seconds)
 * - the two arguments may be preceded by the keywords "left", "center" or "right", indicating the window position
 * - the keyword "soft" maybe added, if the window position is allowed to be adjusted to the data present
 *
 * @code
 * Valid examples for the io.ini file:
 *          TA::filter1 = median_avg
 *          TA::arg1    = soft left 1 1800  (1800 seconds time span for the left leaning window)
 *          RH::filter1 = median_avg
 *          RH::arg1    = 10 600            (strictly centered window spanning 600 seconds and at least 10 points)
 * @endcode
