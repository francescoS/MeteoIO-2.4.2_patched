 * @author Thomas Egger
 * @date   2011-01-24
 * @brief Wind vector averaging.
 * This calculates the vector average over a user given time period. Each wind vector within this period
 * is added and the final sum is normalized by the number of vectors that have been added. Important information:
 * - nodata values are excluded from the mean
 * - Two arguments expected (both have to be fullfilled for the filter to start operating):
 *   - minimal number of points in window
 *   - minimal time interval spanning the window (in seconds)
 * - the two arguments may be preceded by the keywords "left", "center" or "right", indicating the window position
 *   (centered by default)
 * - the keyword "soft" maybe added, if the window position is allowed to be adjusted to the data present
 * Please notice that this filter can currently ONLY be used on VW and DW. It also makes no sens to use it only on one of
 * these two parameters: both should be processed by this filter.
 * CURRENTLY, THIS FILTER DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY (the first parameter is correctly calculated but the second one
 * uses the modified output of the first one and therefore is WRONG).
 * @code
 * Valid examples for the io.ini file:
 *          VW::filter1 = WIND_AVG
 *          VW::arg1    = soft left 1 1800 (1800 seconds time span for the left leaning window)
 *          VW::filter1 = WIND_AVG
 *          VW::arg1    = 10 600          (strictly centered window spanning 600 seconds and at least 10 points)
 * @endcode
